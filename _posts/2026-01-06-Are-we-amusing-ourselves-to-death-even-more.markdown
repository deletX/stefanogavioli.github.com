Welcome to this little experiment where, for the purpose of the following dissertation, through the magic of CSS, the layout of this page has been magically brought back some more years to _simpler times_ so to <s>speak</s> write. <br>
If you read so far and your attention endured for ~8s fo far good job! If you're tired or generally would like to go back feel free to return to the [home page](/). If you like this format better than the _recenter_ one let me know writing [an email](mailto:stefano@stefanogavioli.eu) :-)
