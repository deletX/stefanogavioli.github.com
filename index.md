This is my website! It It has been made with **jekyll**, a good ammount of time, and delivered through **github pages**!

## What is this all about?
I have come across personal website in the past and always found them fascinating! As a computer engineer I could not resist the temptation to tinker around and build my own.

At first I decided to have just my curriculum (which you can check it out [here!](/curriculum)) following the same design i had for the paper one. Some months later I decided it was both not enough and lacked some better design. I then put some more time in css and js (since it is a somewhat static website there's not much backend \*sigh\*) and this is what came out of it. It is the same as the old one, but with a landing page (this one lol) and a Blog (plus some layout redesign).


## Me
I, as stated above, am a computer engineer, love to tinker around. Built a couple of apps, a handful of websites and played around with an arduino a bit.

<div><span>Besides working/studying and having these kinds of entertainment I have much more depth and enjoy spending time in different hobbies. 
For instance you <del>can</del> <strong>must</strong> see the videos I made of my journeys around the globe (<del>at least Europe for now</del> got to VN </span><div class="gif vn"></div><span> on Oct/24 and was amazing!) on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/steps.by.steps/channel/">Instagram account</a> ❤️</span></div>

## What about the Blog
It's a Blog! I first used it somewhat as a portfolio, with material design, responsiveness, and what not, some js with stuff. It was cool and fun making it, and it served it purpose for a while (being learning something with somewhat a purpose). After coming back a few times, I thought to 'renovate' it with a 'brand new' look, again, to have some fun and make it fun to browse. After all, nice links, filling bars, parallax images, responsiveness look smooth and all, but lack personality. They are no fun to watch if the style is _pretty much_ always the same, innit?

So I thought of something, more personal, more vibrant, more fun! And, in a wave of nostalgia, what better design would it be if not the Late 90s/early 2ks websites, with less colors to chose from, less fonts, more gifs, more fun.
